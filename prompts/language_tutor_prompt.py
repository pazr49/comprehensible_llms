LEVEL_A1_PROMPT = """

Instructions for Writing an A1-Level Story for Language Learners:

Each chapter should be around 100-150 words.

1. Use Simple, High-Frequency Vocabulary: Focus on common, everyday words. Avoid complex or rare terms. Introduce new words gradually and repeat them throughout the story. For example, use words like "cat," "house," "run," "eat," and repeat them to reinforce learning.

2. Keep Sentences Short and Simple: Use basic sentence structures, such as Subject-Verb-Object ("The cat drinks milk") and predominantly present tense. Avoid complex sentences and limit pronouns. Instead of “He took it,” use “The boy took the apple.”

3. Repeat Key Phrases and Structures: Reinforce vocabulary and patterns by repeating phrases. Use predictable structures to build familiarity. For example: "The boy goes to the market. The boy buys an apple. The boy eats the apple."

4. Convey Meaning Through Context: Ensure harder words are understandable from the surrounding text. For example, "The cat drank from the bowl. The bowl was full of milk," helps infer the meaning of "bowl.

5. Keep everything in the present tense: For example, "The cat is hungry. It eats the fish. The fish is delicious.

6. Use language and grammar that would be used in real word conversations: Do not use overly formal or complex language that is typically reserved for written text.
